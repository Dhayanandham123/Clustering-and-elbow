# Clustering Analysis using K-Means Clustering

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **unsupervised learning** techniques to discover hidden patterns in data using **clustering algorithms**. The main objective is to group similar data points without using labeled outputs and to determine the optimal number of clusters using the **Elbow Method**.

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

### 1. K-Means Clustering
K-Means partitions the dataset into *K* clusters by minimizing the distance between data points and their respective cluster centroids. The algorithm iteratively updates centroids until convergence.

## 📐 Elbow Method
The **Elbow Method** is used to determine the optimal number of clusters for K-Means.  
It plots the **Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS)** against different values of *K*.  
The point where the curve bends (elbow point) indicates the best number of clusters.

## 📊 Visualization
- Scatter plots are used to visualize cluster formation.
- PCA is applied when the dataset has multiple dimensions to reduce it to two components for better visualization.
- Dendrograms can be used to visualize hierarchical clustering.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn

## 🚀 Workflow
1. Data loading and preprocessing  
2. Feature scaling (if required)  
3. Finding optimal clusters using Elbow Method  
4. Applying K-Means clustering  
5. Applying Agglomerative clustering  
6. Visualizing clusters using scatter plots

## 🎯 Conclusion
Clustering helps uncover meaningful groupings in unlabeled data. The Elbow Method plays a crucial role in selecting the optimal number of clusters, while hierarchical clustering provides insights into data structure through merging patterns.
